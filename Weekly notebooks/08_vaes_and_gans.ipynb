    "Welcome to this Week 8 hands-on tutorial! In this notebook, we’ll explore how to train Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using **PyTorch**. These models are powerful tools for generating new data samples and learning complex data distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, we will build and train both a **VAE** and a **GAN**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**: A probabilistic model that represents input data in a latent space by learning both reconstruction and a prior distribution, useful for generative modeling.  \n",
    "  - **Encoder**: Maps input data to the parameters (mean and variance) of a latent probability distribution.  \n",
    "  - **Decoder**: Reconstructs data from samples drawn from the latent distribution.  \n",
    "  - **Latent Space**: A probabilistic representation of the data distribution that allows for structured sampling and interpolation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**: Consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete against each other. The generator creates fake data samples, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake samples.\n",
    "  - **Generator**: Generates new data samples from random noise.\n",
    "  - **Discriminator**: Classifies data samples as real or fake.\n",
    "  - **Adversarial Training**: The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously, improving each other’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you’ll understand how to:\n",
    "1. Preprocess data for training VAEs and GANs.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this step, we’ll prepare our tools and data to kickstart the project. First, we’ll import the necessary libraries that make it possible to handle data, build and train neural networks, and visualize results effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we’ll load the **MNIST dataset** using `torchvision`. As a quick refresher, the MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits, distributed across 10 classes (digits 0 through 9). Each class has a varying number of images, providing a diverse dataset for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce computational requirements, we’ll **resize** the images and **flatten** them. Resizing adjusts the dimensions of the images, and flattening converts the 2D images into 1D vectors, making it easier for the model to process and speeding up the training process."

    "### Step 6: Building the Generator and Discriminator of the GAN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will build the generator and discriminator models for the GAN. The generator will create fake data samples from random noise, while the discriminator will classify data samples as real or fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generator\n",
    "The generator takes a random noise vector as input and transforms it into a data sample that resembles the real data. It typically consists of several layers of transposed convolutions or fully connected layers. The final activation function used in the generator is usually a **Tanh** function when the goal is image generation. This activation function scales the output to a range between -1 and 1, which helps in stabilizing the training process and ensuring that the generated data has similar properties to the real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discriminator\n",
    "The discriminator takes a data sample as input and outputs a probability indicating whether the sample is real or fake. It typically consists of several layers of convolutions or fully connected layers. The final activation function used in the discriminator is usually a **Sigmoid** function. This activation function outputs a probability between 0 and 1, which is suitable for binary classification tasks where the goal is to distinguish between real and fake samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining these models with appropriate final activation functions, we can ensure that the generator produces realistic data samples and the discriminator effectively distinguishes between real and fake samples."
